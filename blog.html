              <p>Day 5 (or so...):</p>
              <p>Hey there! It feels like it's been forever since I have posted on this blog! Maybe because it has been FOREVER... almost 3 months WOoOW, times flies!</p>
              <p>Here are some updates so far:</p>
              <p>
                <strong>FIRST</strong>: Our moving day is almost there. Only three weeks before the big move to Europe. Mixed feelings are starting to show up, but one has to be able to take a step back and look at the big picture: it's all for the best!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>SECOND</strong>: Thourghout the past couple of months, my legal status in the US was updated. I went from being a legal resident to..... a <strong>US Citizen</strong>! "Say WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!?"
                Crazy, I know! Again, it's all for the best. Being always on the move, either travelling or moving to different countries, and knowing the current instabilities with immigration regulations in the US, becoming a US Citizen was actually a safety move. Whatever happens in the future, being a US Citizen allows me to be able to come back to the US, as I please: another sort of <strong>FREEDOM</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>THIRD</strong>: We are about to revemp the website, and bring it online. Only a couple technical issues to fix before it is live again. Hope you guys will like the updated design. It's is not perfect yet, but we are getting there!
                By the Way, any comments or suggestions are welcome; I'd like to hear what you guys think!

              <p>Day 4:</p>
              <p>
                After the Holidays, it was a bit hard to go back to programming. I will not lie, even though it is fun to code and developp your knowledge, it can sometimes feel like a bit streneous.
                Doing the Mimo classes is a great way to get started, however I would like to have more "hands on" experience. I feel like a great way to learn is actually by teaching yourself through experiences, projects.</br>
                As of early January 2018, I haven't done a New Year's resolutions list, but some impactful decisions were made.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>DECISION 1</strong>: I want to continue in the right direction: becoming a web developper. For this I came to the conclusion, that following online classes is great, but learning through a bootcamp would be better. After looking nights and days for a meaningful bootcamp, that offers knowledge, a certification, and job opportunity (internships), I found one: Coding Academy by Epitech.
                Even though their Code & Go program looks <strong>awesome</strong>, there is a little problem, it is located in France :(
              <p>
                <strong>DECISION 2</strong>: If, for a lot of people, this would be a deal breaker, it isn't one for my wife and I. Actually I am pretty excited. I applied for the program and I am still waiting to hear back from them, but moving to Paris for 5 months (program length) wouldn't be so bad <strong>at all</strong>.
                Since I can remember, my wife has always wanted to live abroad. She did live in Mexico during her studies, but France would be something totally different. Although we have been to Europe a few times (my entire side of the family lives there), we have been leaving/working in the Bay Area for a little over 6 years now, and I am not sure Paris will be anything close to the Bay Area.

              <p>After working all night on trying to figure out why some details
                (background colors, text alignments, etc...) were not working right, it seems, that my laptop needed to sleep on it.

              <p>If somebody would have told me <strong>a week ago</strong> that I would be able to create myt own website from scratch, I would not have believed them!</p>
              <p>Just a few days later, I came across <em>Mimo</em> and started to work on a real blog.</p>
              <p>Here is a link to <a href="https://www.getmimo.com/">Mimo's Website</a></p>
              <p>Click on the link, download the app, and try it out. It is a great way for newbies (like me) to get started quickly. Let me know what you think!
